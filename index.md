## Welcome to the yoga online technique navigator

The free course plan optimizer from yogacompass.org is for yoga teachers and self-practitioners. Several yoga techniques have to be sequenced properly, to reflect the ageless spirit of yoga in a modern class format. Yoga increases the life force and this can be abused, if single yoga techniques are practiced without following ethical principles.
